# 30 Days of Solidity — Community Submissions

Welcome to the official submissions repo for 30 Days of Solidity!

Every day in April, we're building one smart contract at a time — together.

This repo is where you can submit your code for each day's challenge and become part of the community wall of builders.

Whether you’re just getting started or already vibing with Solidity, this is your space to learn, share, and grow. Let’s go!

## How This Repo Works

Each day, we’ll add a new folder (Day01, Day02, ..., Day30) that contains:

- A short challenge description (explaining what to build)
- A submissions folder — where you’ll upload your solution

Inside the `submissions` folder, everyone can create their **own folder named after their GitHub username**, and drop their code in there.

Example:

    Day03/
    ├── challenge.md
    └── submissions/
        ├── dev-sethu/
        │   └── MyToken.sol
        └── alice-dev/
            └── MyToken.sol

## How to Submit Your Code

1. Fork this repo
2. Navigate to the correct day folder (e.g., Day05)
3. Inside the `submissions` folder, create a new folder with your **GitHub username**
4. Drop your `.sol` contract file(s) inside your folder
5. Commit and push the changes to your fork
6. Open a Pull Request to this repo with the title:
    
    `Day05 - Submission by @your-github-username`
    

Boom. You’re done.
